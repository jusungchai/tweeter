# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This web based application allows users to make a tweet which will send the data to the back end server.

Upon success, client will get the values back from the tweet database in the server and render the tweets back onto the client's page.

This application supports both tablet and windows view based on screen resolution.
